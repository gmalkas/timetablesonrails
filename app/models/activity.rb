# = Activity
#
# An activity models a concrete school activity, such as a lecture or a tutoring session.
#
# Each activity can have many groups (e.g a lecture would have only one group since the whole class
# attend to the same lecture, but the class is divided into 4 smaller groups for tutoring sessions).
#
# Each activity has a duration (expressed in hours). It is important to understand that this
# duration does not express the duration of a single instance of the activity
# (e.g 2 hours per week) but the total duration of the activity in a semester.
#
# Hence, if there were 12 lectures of 2 hours each, the activity's duration
# would be 24.
#
# == Teachers
#
# An activity has one or many teachers. The number of teachers is exactly the number
# of groups: if there is only one group, we only need one teachers. But if the class
# is divided in many groups, we need a teacher for each group. A teacher could be
# responsible for more than one group in some cases (another teacher is sick), therefore
# we should not enforce a one-to-one association between teachers and activities.
#
# == Types
#
# There are four types of activities:
#
#   * lecture ('Cours')
#   
#   * tutoring ('TP')
#
#   * exercices ('TD')
#
#   * projects ('Projets')
#
# == States
#
# An activity can be in different states:
#
#   * Waiting ('en attente'): there are candidates but not enough to create a conflict.
#
#   * Conflict ('En conflit'): there are more candidates than available teaching positions.
#     The course's manager or the administrator will have therefore a choice to make.
#
#   * Assigned ('Avec enseignants'): there is just the right number of teachers, the activity
#     should therefore not be open for other candidates.
